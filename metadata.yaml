  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Wazuh server]
  (https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-server.html)
  on Kubernetes. [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) is an open-source XDR and SIEM
  tool for endpoints and cloud workloads.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Wazuh
  on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, TLS certificates
  configuration and more. It allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes
  platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to [Charmed Kubernetes]
  (https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
  XDR and SIEM system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the
  freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Wazhub simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.
