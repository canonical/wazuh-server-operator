  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Wazuh server]
  (https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-server.html)
  on Kubernetes. [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) is an open-source XDR and SIEM
  tool for endpoints and cloud workloads.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Wazuh
  on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, TLS certificates
  configuration and more. It allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes
  platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to [Charmed Kubernetes]
  (https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
  XDR and SIEM system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the
  freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Wazuh simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.

config:
  options:
    agent-password:
      type: secret
      description: >
        The Juju secret ID corresponding to the password used by the agents to connect to Wazuh.
    api-password:
      type: secret
      description: >
        The Juju secret ID corresponding to the password used by the wazuh API.
        Once set, it can't be changed. This configuration is only applied the first time the charm is installed.
        The password must contain at least one upper and lower case letter, a number and a symbol.
    custom-config-repository:
      type: string
      description: >
        The repository URL where the Wazuh configuration is stored. The username has to be provided as in 
        git+ssh://username@repository@branch, where the branch is optional.
        The charms expects the repository to contain a var/ossec directory to be copied over /var/ossec on
        the running instance.
    custom-config-ssh-key:
      type: secret
      description: >
        The Juju secret ID corresponding to the private key for SSH authentication.
        The secret should contain a single key, "value", which maps to the actual SSH key. 
        To create the secret, run the following command: 
        `juju add-secret my-custom-config-ssh-key value=<ssh-key> && juju grant-secret my-custom-config-ssh-key wazuh-server`,
        and use the secret ID output to configure this option.
