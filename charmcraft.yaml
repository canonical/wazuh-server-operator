  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Wazuh Server]
  (https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/wazuh-server.html)
  on Kubernetes. [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) is an open-source XDR and SIEM
  tool for endpoints and cloud workloads.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Wazuh
  on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, TLS certificates
  configuration and more. It allows for deployment on various
  [Kubernetes platforms](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) offered by Canonical.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
  XDR and SIEM system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the
  freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Wazuh simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
  into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
  enterprise deployments.

    agent-password:
      type: secret
      description: >
        The Juju secret ID corresponding to the password used by the agents to connect to Wazuh.
    custom-config-repository:
      type: string
      description: >
        A repository URL where configuration files are stored. The URL must be provided in the
        format git+ssh://username@repository@ref, where 'username' is mandatory and 'ref' is
        optional and may be either a branch name or tag name. Tags are encouraged for
        reproducibility and for efficiency. If a branch is provided, the charm will re-pull the
        configuration on most charm events, as it cannot guarantee that it has the latest commits
        otherwise. The following paths, if they exist in the repository, will be synced over the
        corresponding paths in the charm filesystem: var/ossec/, etc/rsyslog.conf, etc/rsyslog.d/,
        usr/share/filebeat/, etc/filebeat/
    custom-config-ssh-key:
      type: secret
      description: >
        The Juju secret ID corresponding to the private key for SSH authentication to the git repository.
        The secret should contain a single key, "value", which maps to the actual SSH key. 
        To create the secret, run the following command: 
        `juju add-secret my-custom-config-ssh-key value=<ssh-key> && juju grant-secret my-custom-config-ssh-key wazuh-server`,
        and use the secret ID output to configure this option.
    enable-vulnerability-detection:
      type: boolean
      description: >
        If true, the charm will ensure that Wazuh's vulnerability detection module is disabled.
        This overrides any configuration in the custom-config-repository. The primary purpose is
        to prevent the automatic download of Wazuh's vulnerability database upon initial installation
        if that feature is not going to be utilized. If not set, defaults to 'true'.
      default: true
    logs-ca-cert:
      type: string
      description: >
        The certification authority certificate used to sign client certificates that the server
        should accept logs from.
