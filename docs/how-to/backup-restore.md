# How to back up and restore

All persisted data are stored in the "Wazuh Indexer".

To back up and restore the "Wazuh Indexer" data, please refer to the [OpenSearch documentation](https://charmhub.io/opensearch/docs/h-create-backup).

Backups rely on S3 storage; please also refer to the [OpenSearch documentation](https://charmhub.io/opensearch/docs/h-configure-s3) for reference.
